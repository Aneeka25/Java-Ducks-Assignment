#Duck Simulator Project
This project demonstrates the Strategy Design Pattern using a Duck Simulator.
The implementation allows dynamic assignment of behaviors such as flying, quacking, and swimming to different duck types.

Key Features:
1. Utilizes interfaces like FlyBehavior, QuackBehavior, and SwimBehavior for flexible behavior assignment.
2. Includes duck types: MallardDuck, RedheadDuck, RubberDuck, and DecoyDuck.
3. Demonstrates polymorphism with behavior methods: performFly(), performQuack(), and performSwim().
4. Provides setter methods to change behaviors at runtime.
